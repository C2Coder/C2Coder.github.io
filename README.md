# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer who loves turning old hardware into something useful. Currently running **Endeavour OS** on my trusty work laptop - because good software can make any machine feel new again.

## ðŸ”§ My Setup

- **OS**: Endeavour OS (Arch-based goodness)
- **Hardware**: 8th gen intel (4 cores, 8 threads), 16GB of RAM
- **Desk**: A old big desk *from work*, just my laptop and a second-hand 27inch curved monitor (with a backlight that sometimes just turns off), no mouse, no keyboard

## ðŸ”§ My Server

- **OS**: Ubutnu 24.04 (good old ubuntu)
- **Hardware**: Free tier Oracle server (the cheapest I could get)
- **Software**: [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) (for the sites), [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/) (so i dont loose da files) and [Frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) (so I dont have to torture my VPS every time i want to host something)

## ðŸŒ± What I'm up to

- Learning something new every day
- Proving that you don't need the latest hardware to do great work

## ðŸ’» Technologies I work with

- Endeavour (on my daily)
- Ubuntu (on my servers)
- Python (for everything i can)
- Nginx
- Frp
